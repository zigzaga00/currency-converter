this simple currency converter builds on the ideas used in the [tip-calculator](https://github.com/zigzaga00/tip-calculator) project

it (in my opinion 😛) improves on that project by including two options for the user to choose from when it comes to calculating new values to display and a reset button to clean things up back to their original state

this project therefore (probably) improves on the [tip-calculator](https://github.com/zigzaga00/tip-calculator) project by:

- [x] giving the user multiple choices to click on
- [x] displaying different results according to the chosen button
- [x] facilitating a way to reset the html to its original state
- [ ] making things more dynamic by including api calls
- [ ] adding a way to feed your pets 🐱 🐶 🐟 whilst on holiday
